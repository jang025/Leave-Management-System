## 5.2 About the App

### App Name: Leave Management System

#### Description

<p>This is a full-stack leave management system that allows employees to apply for leave and managers to approve or reject leave requests. Employees can track balances for annual and sick leave, while managers have a full view of pending leave requests.</p>

#### Why I Built This

<p>I built this app to learn full-stack development (React + Express + PostgreSQL), improve authentication and authorization skills, and practice working with real-world relational data.</p>
